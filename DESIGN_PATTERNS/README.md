# Design Pattern - Overview
Design patterns represent the best practices used by experienced object-oriented software developers.
Design patterns are solutions to general problems that software developers faced during software development.
These solutions were obtained by trial and error by numerous software developers over quite a substantial period.

### Usage of Design Pattern
Design Patterns have two main usages in software development.

### Common platform for developers
Design patterns provide a standard terminology and are specific to particular scenario.
For example, a singleton design pattern signifies use of single object so all developers familiar with single
design pattern will make use of single object, and they can tell each other that program is following a singleton
pattern.

### Best Practices
Design patterns have been evolved over a long period, and they provide the best solutions to certain problems faced
during software development. Learning these patterns helps inexperienced developers to learn software design in an easy
and faster way.

### Types of Design Patterns
There are 23 design patterns which can be classified in three categories: **Creational, Structural** and **Behavioral** patterns.
